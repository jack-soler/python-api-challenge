This notebook performs a weather and hotel search analysis for a set of cities around the world. It retrieves weather data, filters cities based on specific criteria, and then finds the nearest hotels using the Geoapify API. The results are visualized through scatter plots showing relationships between latitude and various weather metrics. Finally, an interactive map is created to display city locations and their corresponding hotels. Data and plots are saved for further analysis and presentation.
